    <h1>How was "<b>Great Barrier Reef "</b>Formed?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
    <p><b>Coral reefs begin to form when free-swimming coral larvae attach to submerged rocks or other hard surfaces along the edges of islands or continents. As the corals grow and expand, reefs take on one of three major characteristic structures â€” fringing, barrier or atoll.</b></p>
